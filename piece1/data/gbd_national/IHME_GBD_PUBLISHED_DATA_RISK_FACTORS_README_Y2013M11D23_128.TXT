PUBLISHED DATA ON RISK FACTORS FROM THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE 2010 STUDY (GBD 2010)

09/2013 - Country-level results from the GBD 2010 were published
11/2013 - Updated results were published. The previously published datasets contained data for two groups of risk factors, namely Metabolic Risk Factors (Physiological risks) and Air Pollution. Both were based on the sum of individual risk factors. However, since the correlation structure between the individual risk factors is unknown, the group data likely overestimate the burden from these groups of risk factors and should not be used.
